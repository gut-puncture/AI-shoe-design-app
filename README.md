## Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

### Step 1: Create Hugging Face Space

1. Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Click "Create new Space"
3. Configure your space:
   - **Owner**: Your Hugging Face username
   - **Space name**: `AI-shoe-design-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **SDK**: Gradio
   - **Hardware**: CPU Basic (free) or upgrade as needed
   - **Visibility**: Public

### Step 2: Get Hugging Face API Token

1. Go to [Hugging Face Settings > Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click "New token"
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `github-sync` (or similar)
   - **Role**: **Write** (required for pushing to spaces)
4. Copy the generated token

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add:
   - **Name**: `HF_TOKEN`
   - **Secret**: Your Hugging Face token from Step 2

### Step 4: Automatic Sync with GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions that automatically sync your code to Hugging Face Spaces:

- **`.github/workflows/sync_to_hf.yml`**: Syncs code on every push to main branch
- **`.github/workflows/check_file_size.yml`**: Ensures files are under 10MB limit

The sync happens automatically when you push to the main branch. You can also trigger it manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables in Hugging Face

In your Hugging Face Space settings, add these environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FAL_KEY=your_fal_ai_api_key_here
```

**Getting API Keys:**

- **OpenAI API Key**: 
  1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  2. Create a new API key
  3. Ensure you have access to the o3-2025-04-16 model (may require special access)

- **fal.ai API Key**:
  1. Go to [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/)
  2. Sign up/login and go to your dashboard
  3. Generate an API key

### Step 6: Access Your Space

Once everything is configured, your Space will be available at:
`https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-shoe-design-app`

## Local Development

To run locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-shoe-designer.git
cd ai-shoe-designer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export FAL_KEY="your_fal_ai_key"

# Run the app
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:7860`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key with o3 model access | Yes |
| `FAL_KEY` | Your fal.ai API key | Yes |

## API Models Used

- **OpenAI o3-2025-04-16**: Advanced reasoning model for design consultation
- **fal.ai Imagen4/preview**: High-quality text-to-image generation

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Internet connection for API calls
- Sufficient RAM for image processing (recommended: 4GB+)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"o3-2025-04-16 model not found"**
   - Ensure you have access to the o3 model (may require special OpenAI access)
   - Check your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits

2. **"fal.ai connection error"**
   - Verify your FAL_KEY is correct
   - Check fal.ai service status

3. **GitHub Actions sync failing**
   - Ensure `HF_TOKEN` secret is set correctly with **Write** permissions
   - Check that your Hugging Face Space exists and name matches the workflow

4. **Memory errors with large images**
   - Try reducing image file sizes before upload
   - Consider upgrading to GPU hardware on Hugging Face Spaces

5. **Slow response times**
   - Upgrade to GPU hardware on Hugging Face Spaces
   - Consider reducing the number of images uploaded simultaneously

### Performance Tips

- **For better o3 responses**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions along with your images
- **For better image generation**: Use the detailed prompts generated by o3 rather than generic descriptions
- **For faster performance**: Upgrade to GPU hardware on Hugging Face Spaces
